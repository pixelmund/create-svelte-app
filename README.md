# Create Svelte App

### Why should i use create-svelte-app?

- Use it if you're tired by repeating the setup of your svelte/sapper app everytime.
- Typescript support for both webpack and rollup projects (svelte and sapper).
- Svelte preprocessors already setup.
- Svelte config already setup for vscode.
- Easy project bootstrap, simply answer some questions and your project is ready to go!

#### Getting started

```bash

npm i @pixelmund/create-svelte-app -g


```

#### How to

If you installed the package globally simply run

```bash

create-svelte-app [alias: csa]

or

create-svelte-app [alias: csa] path [CLI will use the folder name]

You can also use npx:

npx @pixelmund/create-svelte-app

```

#### The CLI will ask you questions about your project

##### For Example:

`Svelte or Sapper?`
`Rollup or Webpack?`
`Typescript?`
`Css-preprocesssor?`

...will add more later

...feel free to create an issue with your needs
